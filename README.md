# splitter
Handy little script for splitting big auido file into a smaller tracks
It uses ffmpeg as backend and pydub as a wrapper.

To split a track you need to put it to the same folder where script is and write down desired track names with timestamps into the tracks.txt file in similar manner:
Track 1;00:00
Track 2;02:53
Track 3;04:20
and so on

Then just launch the script, answer prompted questions and you're done!
